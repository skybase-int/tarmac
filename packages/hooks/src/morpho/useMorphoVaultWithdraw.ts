/**
 * Hook for withdrawing assets from a Morpho vault (ERC-4626 compliant).
 *
 * The withdraw function burns shares and returns the underlying assets to the receiver.
 * Per ERC-4626: withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) returns (uint256 shares)
 *
 * No token approval is required for withdrawals since the user is burning their own
 * vault shares (which they already own) to receive the underlying assets.
 *
 * @param amount - The amount of underlying assets to withdraw (in asset decimals, e.g., 6 for USDC)
 * @param vaultAddress - The Morpho vault address to withdraw from (required)
 * @param enabled - Whether the hook is enabled
 * @param gas - Optional gas limit override
 * @param onMutate - Callback when transaction is initiated
 * @param onStart - Callback when transaction hash is received
 * @param onSuccess - Callback when transaction is confirmed
 * @param onError - Callback when transaction fails
