        The Sky Token Rewards (STR) rate is variable, and is determined by the following factors: the current
        issuance rate of the reward token in question, as set through the relevant onchain governance
        processes pertinent to the reward token in question (for example, SKY issuance rate is decided by the
        decentralised Maker/Sky ecosystem onchain governance), the current market price of the reward token in
        question, and the userâ€™s proportional percentage of the total supply within the pool of funds accruing
        that particular reward. STR rate may be volatile. The rate provided here is an estimate of the
        relevant STR rate expressed in expected rate per annum, should be automatically updated every 5

        The Sky Savings Rate (SSR) is variable, determined by decentralised Sky Ecosystem onchain governance,

        The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt or tokens that can be issued within the SKY protocol,

    title: 'Peg Stability Module (PSM)',
    description: (
      <Text className="leading-5 text-white/80" variant="small">
        Peg Stability Modules (PSMs) are smart contracts that allow users to convert certain stablecoins
        directly with the Sky Protocol for USDS or DAI at a fixed rate and with relatively low fees. They are
        designed to maintain the stability of USDS and DAI. Unlike decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions,
        PSM operations do not involve trading between users. Instead, they are direct, non-custodial
        conversions (generate and burn) executed with the decentralized smart contracts of the Sky Protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through PSMs, USDS or DAI is obtained via predictable-rate conversion (typically a 1:1 ratio with
        certain stablecoins, or, in the case of sUSDS, for an amount reflecting its current price) rather than
        through borrowing. For example, given the existence of a USDC-backed PSM, a user could supply 100 USDC
        stablecoins to generate100 USDS or 100 DAI (minus fees), without taking on any debt. Given that PSM
        operations are facilitated on the Sky Protocol directly and not on a DEX, price slippage (i.e., the
        difference between the expected price of a token and the actual price when traded) is not a concern.
        Zero Sky Protocol fees and no slippage are some of the benefits of using PSM, which adds liquidity to
        the assets backing the PSM. That liquidity helps to keep the value of USDS and DAI stable.
