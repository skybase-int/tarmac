        The Sky Token Rewards (STR) rate is variable, and is determined by the following factors: the current
        issuance rate of the reward token in question, as set through the relevant onchain governance
        processes pertinent to the reward token in question (for example, SKY issuance rate is decided by the
        decentralised Maker/Sky ecosystem onchain governance), the current market price of the reward token in
        question, and the userâ€™s proportional percentage of the total supply within the pool of funds accruing
        that particular reward. STR rate may be volatile. The rate provided here is an estimate of the
        relevant STR rate expressed in expected rate per annum, should be automatically updated every 5

        The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt or tokens that can be issued within the SKY protocol,

        PSMs are smart contracts that allow users to convert certain stablecoins directly with the Sky
        Protocol for USDS or DAI at a fixed rate, with zero protocol fees; however, gas fees will apply. They
        are designed to maintain the stability of USDS and DAI. Unlike decentralized exchange (DEX)
        transactions, PSM operations do not involve trading between users. Instead, they are direct,
        non-custodial conversions (generate and burn) executed with the decentralized smart contracts of the
        Sky Protocol.

      <Text className="leading-5 text-white/80" variant="small">
        When you hold SKY tokens, you maintain the right to participate in the process of Sky Ecosystem
        Governance voting. That means that you have the ability to contribute to the community-driven,
        decentralized ecosystem decision-making process, which occurs through onchain voting.
        <br />
        <br />
        The voting power delegation feature of the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol enables you to entrust
        your voting power to a delegate of your choosing, who can then vote in the Sky Ecosystem Governance
        process on your behalf. You can choose one delegate per SKY position. If you want to entrust your SKY
        to two delegates using the Staking Engine, you will need to create two separate positions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Delegates in receipt of token voting power can never directly access any tokens delegated to them,
        including staked tokens. Throughout the delegation process, you always own and are in control of your
        staked tokens, and you can change your delegate at any time. Staking to delegate your voting power may
        be a useful option for governance token holders who have limited time to allocate to the process, who
        want to save on the cost of gas involved in voting on their own, and who also want to earn Staking
        Rewards.

        If the value of your collateral (SKY) drops below the liquidation price noted here, some or all of
        your collateral may be auctioned to repay the amount of USDS that you borrowed. Note that a one-hour
        price update delay applies. In other words, when SKY drops below a user&apos;s liquidation price it
        will only start applying one hour later. This is called the OSM delay in technical terms, and it also
        applies to any legacy Maker MCD vault.
