        The Sky Token Rewards (STR) rate is variable, and is determined by the following factors: the current
        issuance rate of the reward token in question, as set through the relevant onchain governance
        processes pertinent to the reward token in question (for example, SKY issuance rate is decided by the
        decentralised Maker/Sky ecosystem onchain governance), the current market price of the reward token in
        question, and the userâ€™s proportional percentage of the total supply within the pool of funds accruing
        that particular reward. STR rate may be volatile. The rate provided here is an estimate of the
        relevant STR rate expressed in expected rate per annum, should be automatically updated every 5
        minutes and is powered by data provided by a third party (

        The Sky Savings Rate (SSR) is variable, determined by decentralised Sky Ecosystem onchain governance,

        The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt or tokens that can be issued within the SKY protocol,

      <Text className="leading-5 text-white/80" variant="small">
        PSMs are smart contracts that allow users to convert certain stablecoins directly with the Sky
        Protocol for USDS or DAI at a fixed rate, with zero protocol fees; however, gas fees will apply. They
        are designed to maintain the stability of USDS and DAI. Unlike decentralized exchange (DEX)
        transactions, PSM operations do not involve trading between users. Instead, they are direct,
        non-custodial conversions (generate and burn) executed with the decentralized smart contracts of the
        Sky Protocol.
