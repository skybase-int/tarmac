    'By using the Staking Engine, you acknowledge that this feature does not involve validator or consensus staking and that your SKY remains in a non-custodial smart contract. Borrowing USDS against staked SKY may expose you to liquidation risk if the collateral value falls below required thresholds. Participation may also involve market and smart contract risk and may have legal or tax implications depending on your jurisdiction. Reward and borrow rates are variable and determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance. You should carefully evaluate these risks and seek independent professional advice before proceeding.'
