    'By using the Upgrade feature, you acknowledge that token conversions are subject to market volatility, governance decisions, smart contract risk, and conversion restrictions. The MKR to SKY upgrade is now uni-directional. As of September 22, 2025, Sky Ecosystem Governance has implemented a delayed upgrade penalty that gradually reduces the amount of SKY received when upgrading from MKR. The penalty starts at 1% during the first three months following its introduction, then increases by an additional 1% every three months thereafter. This incremental increase will continue until the upgrade value is reduced by 100% after 25 years. The token values of MKR and SKY may fluctuate, and DAI and USDS may depeg from the value of the U.S. dollar. Participation may also have legal or tax implications depending on your jurisdiction. You should carefully review these risks and seek independent professional advice before proceeding.'
