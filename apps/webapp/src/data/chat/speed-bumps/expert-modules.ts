    'By supplying USDS to the Expert module to mint stUSDS, you acknowledge that returns are variable and depend on borrower demand and utilization. Rates may change at any time based on market conditions. stUSDS carries a higher degree of risk than sUSDS due to exposure to collateralized borrower risks, which can reduce the value of redeemable USDS from the stUSDS module, and immediate withdrawal liquidity may be limited when utilization is high. Participation may also involve risks related to USDS peg stability, oracle performance, smart contract risk, and potential legal or tax implications depending on your jurisdiction. You should carefully assess these risks and seek independent professional advice before participating.'
