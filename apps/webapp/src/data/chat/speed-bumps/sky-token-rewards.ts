    'By supplying USDS to the Sky Token Rewards ("STRs") smart contract, you acknowledge that STRs are distributed in proportion to your share of the total USDS contributed by all participants to the respective rewards smart contract. Your share, and therefore the rate at which STRs become redeemable, may fluctuate as the total size of the USDS pool changes over time. Sky.money does not control or guarantee the issuance, rate, or distribution of STRs. The value or availability of STRs may change at any time. Your participation may have legal or tax implications depending on your jurisdiction and STRs may be subject to market or smart contract risk. You should carefully assess these risks and seek independent professional advice before participating.'
